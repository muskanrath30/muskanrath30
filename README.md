## About
I am a Data Scientist with 4 years of total work experience and 3 years of experience in Data Science. I love building AI & ML projects and enjoy shipping them as fullâ€‘stack web applications. I work with model development, prototyping UIs (Streamlit), and backend services (Flask/Django/FastAPI). At present I am also exploring integrating Node.js, React.js, and .NET with AI for web; and Flutter/.NET for mobility. I am open to working with broader software development technologies such as Java and .NET.

## Top Projects

<!--START_SECTION:projects-->
1- SelfGPT: A RAG based AI application which will answer questions about me. <br>
2- Interview based practice assistant: An agentic based project using CrewAI frameworks and Langchain <br>
3- Deposit Growth Prediction for Branch Expansion Strategy for BFSIs: A classical ML project predicting deposit growth percentage based on RBI's data from 2019 to 2024 for 60 pincodes (urban, semi-urban and rural) all across the states in India. <br>
4- Summarisation of Technical Research Papers: Papers trained on dataset (BERT model was finetuned) and then BART was used for summarisation. <br>
5- Market Research Agent (in-progress): A market research agent which uses FastAPI to collect details from customers and ask questions. <br>
6- Digital Twin to Optimize biopharmaceutical manufacturing process: A classical ML project for 40 batches of antibodies involving two steps. First, predicting yield and second, creating a simulation platform based on constrained optimization problem to detect the amount of changes to each parameters for achieving a desirable yield. <br>
7- Custom NER for Text Summarisation and Question Answering: NER using Spacy, Question answering using roberta base squad 2 model from hugging face and summarisation using nltk (on the basis of scoring of sentences). <br>
